Blog Post #1 - Welcome!

The second semester is well underway, and one of our professors has already given us the midterm. There was a lot of fear initially about starting this blog. Will I be judged? What if they think less of me?

The reality is that I’m a newbie when it comes to cybersecurity, and this blog is literally a log of my journey. I initially wanted to start it at the beginning of last semester as an idea from my professor. However, I didn’t get around to it until now, and I’m so glad I did. Just setting up this blog has introduced me to a host of new tools that I had never used before—the first being GitHub. I had tried exploring it before, but nothing like what it took to set up this site.

I want to dive into so many different things, and I can’t wait to get started. Are you ready to go? Ready, set… let’s dive in!
